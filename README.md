# Fish all the fish!

This repo contains a frontend and backend for a multiplayer game made for a team assignment for the Codaisseur Academy. It uses Typescript, Koa, routing-controllers and TypeORM in the backend and React/Redux in the frontend. The backend exposes a REST API but also sends messages over websockets using SocketIO.
